# Miscellaneous Sole Trader
# Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project
I have chosen to use my own idea to build a website for Miscellaneous Sole Trader as Interactive Frontend Development milestone project. Being owner of this business and having full control of business and resources will help me create well deserved website. Moreover, I have come to know by visiting some exhibition and local businesses that having own website is huge benefit as well as there is whole lot of new horizon to be discovered with distributor and wholesaler all over the World.

My idea is to keep design simple using well known website template, which help user(s) or customer(s) navigate through website easily with confident. Also, I have kept in mind that having website full of content and loads of information on single page will make it look tawdry. My intention is to have simple yet information rich webpages with modern and attractive design.

### Wireframe
I have created wireframe for this project to have overview of this website, how it will look and where all option(s) will be located based on requirement. This wireframe can be found on following link:

https://github.com/hidayatmansuri/Interactive_Frontend/tree/master/Wireframe

## Features
In the modern days menu bar on larger screen devices embedded on right at the top of the page while for smaller screen device and for the same site menu bar become drop-down. That functionality is great but, if one customer navigating another customer on same website from different screen size devices will have difficulty as menu bar option(s) has been altered or located on different place(s). That is why on this project we have decided to have same burger bar icon for all the devices located at same place with fix position, which means menu bar icon will be available at any point of website.

### Dashboard
We will have Dashboard with interactive charts. We are having 2 lots of charts from 2 different marketplaces. Where top charts are belongs to Amazon while bottom are belongs to eBay.

For Amazon charts there are different ways to filter data, such as choosing Month from combo box located on top or can use brush-on function to choose duration on 2nd Line-Chart or Bar-Chart. Depends on chosen filter(s), Scattered-Plot-Chart will display orders against average price. While first Line-Chart will display weekly turn over and second will have data for units sold every week. Lastly, Bar-Chart will have information of average price of good sold every week.

For eBay charts there is same functionality of combo box to choose month to display data accordingly on interactive charts. While Bar-Chart have brush-on functionality to choose duration. Line-Chart will show Daily turnover while Bar-Chart will show units sold every day. Two Pie-Charts are showing Amount spend by every county and amount spend on every product respectively. Both Pie-Chart are interactive too, by clicking on any bar will iterate Data accordingly on other related charts.

### Menu Bar
Menu options will be highlighted with different colour icon depends on which page customer surfing on. Such as, if customer is on About Us page, icon of the About Us option in menu will be in dark pink colour.

### Product Page
Product page have clean and tidy design where all the products image have been lined with product name right under every product along with "i" icon. Description for all the product are hidden and will be displayed on demand. Description can be accessed by tapping or clicking on the "i" icon next to the product name.

### Contact US
Contact us form is fully functioning, where customer can fill require field(s) and send their question or query to us. This form has been created with help of emailjs. If required field(s) are left blank would show customer a error and form would not be send without those field information. At the end with required field(s) information, once 'Send' clicked or tapped, it will show customer a success message too.

### Feature left to Implement
I will be adding payment feature in future where customer can complete their order solely on website.

I have also added search field, but the coding has bug which I think it is outside of knowledge I have gained so far. However, I have tried to make it functional and have achieved very little success. I am determined to make it work and will have that functionality up and running in very near future as I seek more knowledge.

Charts on Dashboard are appearing nicely on first attempt which are located on home page of this project. Once we visit another page and come back on Dashboard, charts normally doesn't appear automatically which seems confusing. I have tried to find solution and but have no success so far. To make all charts re-appear please use "CTRL + refresh".

## Testing
I have tested this project on number of devices (iPhone5, iPhoneX, HTC U12+, Google Pixel 3 XL, One Plus One, Pocophone, Samsung s20e, Samsung Tablet, iPad, Honor 7) as well as on desktop I have used majority of web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla, Safari, IE10, Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Edge(Chromium Beta), Opera, Vivaldi). Also, I have tested this project on different desktop with different configuration, where I have notices that Charts are taking bit longer on older generation device while with newer generation it's lot quicker comparatively.

About US and Delivery pages are only containing information about company and services. Where on About Us page I have placed map for company's different active locations with addresses right under. Map have no issue with any size of device and any generation of PC or browser, works perfectly for me.

Contact Us page have required fields for customer to get in touch with company related to products or order(s). Within the form there are some mandatory fields which needs to be filled with required information before submitting or jumping on next field. This form is fully activated and customer can get in touch with company or business providing required field. I have tried few times and it works on all type of devices.

Dashboard for this project does work but, sometime required refresh on first time for charts to be appear depends on device and processor. Also, charts do not resize themselves if device turn at 90 degree vertically or horizontally, screen needs to be refreshed and charts will adjust themselves. I have tried to keep charts at fixed size but would look skeleton on some devices. That is when I have come across with charts property called ".width($('#chartCumulativeDVH').innerWidth())" for width and ".height($('#chartCumulativeDVH').innerHeight())" for height. This property does adjust chart according to screen size but change in screen size does required refresh for these properties to work.

## Deployment

To deploy this project or repositiory from GitHub to local machine, following steps will help you get it done:
1. For this we will use Git Bash, which can be installed from https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. once GitBash is installed and ready to use, we will open GitBash
3. Here we will use "git clone" command to copy repositiory to local machine
4. for git clone command we need URL from where repository needs to be cloned from, which you can get it from github using this URL (https://github.com/hidayatmansuri/Interactive_Frontend)
5. Just above list of files there will be green button saying "Clone or Download", that is where repositiory URL resides
6. Once you have copy that URL, on GitBash type command "git clone" and copy that URL, which will look as follows on your GitBash
7. git clone https://github.com/hidayatmansuri/Interactive_Frontend.git
8. and press ENTER
9. this will copy whole respository on your working directory

I have deployed this project on GitHub through AWS Cloud9 using its command base terminal functionality, where it resides under Interactive_Frontend repositories.

To deploy this project on github using AWS cloud9 commands as follows:
1.  git init - to get into github
2.  git status - to find out all changes have been made within files
3.  git add . - to add all amended files to github server
4.  git commit -m - to commit all changes with reason
5.  git push - to add all committed changes to github server which will be followed by username and password for account

Also, I have deployed this project using GitHub desktop application. Where application have created a folder in which all files related project should be stored. Any changes made on the files stored within this folder will be picked by application, which needs to be committed and push to GitHub. This project resides under hidayatmansuri.github.io repository

To deploy and publish this project using GitHub Desktop Application, steps as follows:

1.  Create a file using username followed by github.io
2.  Select or create folder where you like to keep all the files for the project
3.  Copy all the files to that newly created or selected folder
4.  Any changed made within that folder will be picked up by application and will prompt user to commit
5.  Once committed all the changes will prompt user with push notification which will push all the changes to related server

Both of these methods stored data on same place under my account, but one is command base application while another one is desktop application.

How emailjs will work with project

To make emailjs work with your project, you need to start creating a free account on emailjs.com (https://dashboard.emailjs.com/account/create). Once account is created, varified and logged in you start creating connection as follows:
1. From Email Services add new service
2. Where you will be presented with list of providers to choose one from
3. Once provider is chosen you have to connect account and allow in the request for permission
4. This will provide you with a API key to connect emailjs with your project or website. API key can also be retrieved from Account tab.
5. In your left-side panel go to installation and copy your API key initialization just how shows it to your HTML page.
6. Then, go to Email Templates and you already should have one created, otherwise just create a new one.
7. Once all that done, go to Installtion tab on left had side of pan and copy that script to your html code just before body tag closes and replace your API key in emailjs.init
8. To make it all work you can create a whole new JS file and connect with html page or write script just after installtion code you have copied from emailjs

### Command base
