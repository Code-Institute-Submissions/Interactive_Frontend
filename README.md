# Miscellaneous Sole Trader
# Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project
I have chosen to use my own idea to build a website for Miscellaneous Sole Trader as Interactive Frontend Development milestone project. Being owner of this business and having full control of business and resources will help me create well deserved website. Moreover, I have come to know by visiting some exhibition and local businesses that having own website is huge benifit as weel as there is whole lot of new horizon to be discovered with distributor and wholesaler all over the World.

My idea is to keep design simple using well known website template, which help user(s) or customer(s) naviagate through website easily with confident. Also I have kept in mind that having website full of content and loads of information on single page will make it look tawdry. My intention is to have simple yet information rich webpages with modern and attractive design.

### Wireframe
I have created wireframe for this project to have overview of this website, how it will look and where all option(s) will be located based on requirement. This wireframe can be found on following link:

## Features
In the modern days menu bar on larger screen devices embedded on right at the top of the page while for smaller screen device and for the same site menu bar become drop-down. That functionality is great but, if one customer navigating another customer on same website from different screen size devices will have difficulty as menu bar option(s) has been altered or located on different place(s). That is why on this project we have dicided to have same burger bar icon for all the devices located at same place with fix position, which means menu bar icon will be available at any point of website.

### Demo for Menu
Menu options will be highlighted with different colour icon depends on which page customer surfing on. Such as, if customer is on About Us page, icon of the About Us option in menu will be in dark pink colour.

Product page have clean and tidy design where all the products image ahve been lined with product name right under every product along with "i" icon.

### Demo for Touch Functionality devices
Previously, I had same functionality with hover over on buttons, which was not compatible with touchscreen functionality devices.  To come over this issue I have decided to add little ‘i’ icon for description which is compatible for all types of devices.

### Demo for Marketplaces and Social Media links
I have activated all the links for marketplaces and social media. Links with marketplace will take customers to Amazon and eBay, where they can make payment and choose from more products. While with social media links will take customer to our social media pages for activities we carry out and can follow for future updates.

### Feature left to Implement
I will be adding payment feature in future where customer can complete their order solely on website.

Contact Us form is in function but submitting form will refresh form rather than sending data. For full form functionality I need to gain knowledge.

### Demo for Contact Us page
https://github.com/hidayatmansuri/hidayatmansuri.github.io/blob/master/images/ContactUs.gif

In future there will home or landing page will be added too which will be linked to company logo.

## Testing
I have tested this project on number of devices (iPhone5, iPhoneX, HTC U12+, One Plus One, Pocophone, Samsung s20e, Samsung Tablet, iPad, Honor 7) as well as on desktop I have used majority of web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla, Safari, IE10, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Vivaldi).

Some of Android devices had issue with background image zooming in, which was sorted with media query.

I preferred menu with transparent background for modern look, but that was not feasible for small devices where menu options were getting disappeared in content of website. To resolve this issue, I have created media query where any devices with under 1200 pixel will have background colour for menu options.

Also, floating menu icon was small round for minimal design, but it was barely visible on smaller devices which was pointed out by one of my friend while testing. To resolve this issue, I have decided to make menu icon bit bigger and brighter with well-known burger bar icon.

Footer which is same for all pages have all the marketplace and social media links which are activated except Twitter which yet to be activated. All links are opening the relevant pages in new tab as required and will be highlighted as and when hover over in the desktop mode. For touch functionality device it requires tapping on.

About US and Delivery pages are only containing information about company and services.

Contact Us page have required fields for customer to get in touch with company related to products or order(s). Within the form there are some mandatory fields which needs to be filled with required information before submitting or jumping on next field.
