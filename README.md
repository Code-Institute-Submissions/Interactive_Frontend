# Miscellaneous Sole Trader
# Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project
I have chosen to use my own idea to build a website for Miscellaneous Sole Trader as Interactive Frontend Development milestone project. Being owner of this business and having full control of business and resources will help me create well deserved website. Moreover, I have come to know by visiting some exhibition and local businesses that having own website is huge benifit as weel as there is whole lot of new horizon to be discovered with distributor and wholesaler all over the World.

My idea is to keep design simple using well known website template, which help user(s) or customer(s) naviagate through website easily with confident. Also I have kept in mind that having website full of content and loads of information on single page will make it look tawdry. My intention is to have simple yet information rich webpages with modern and attractive design.

### Wireframe
I have created wireframe for this project to have overview of this website, how it will look and where all option(s) will be located based on requirement. This wireframe can be found on following link:

https://github.com/hidayatmansuri/Interactive_Frontend/blob/master/support/Wireframe_MST.bmpr

## Features
In the modern days menu bar on larger screen devices embedded on right at the top of the page while for smaller screen device and for the same site menu bar become drop-down. That functionality is great but, if one customer navigating another customer on same website from different screen size devices will have difficulty as menu bar option(s) has been altered or located on different place(s). That is why on this project we have dicided to have same burger bar icon for all the devices located at same place with fix position, which means menu bar icon will be available at any point of website.

### Dashboard
We will have Dashboard with interactive charts. We are having 2 lots of charts from 2 different marketplaces. Where top charts are belongs to Amazon while bottom are belongs to eBay.

For Amazon charts there are different ways to filter data, such as choosing Month from combo box located on top or can use brush-on function to choose perticuler duration on 2nd Line-Chart or Bar-Chart. Depends on choosen filter(s), Scattered-Plot-Chart will display orders against average price. While first Line-Chart will display weekly turn over and second will have data for units sold every week. Lastly, Bar-Chart will have information of average price of good sold every week.

For eBay charts there is same functionality of combo box to choose month to display data accordingly on interactive charts. While Bar-Chart have brush-on functionality to choose particular duration. Line-Chart will show Daily turnover while Bar-Chart will show units sold everyday. Two Pie-Charts are showing Amount spend by every county and amount spen on every product respectively. Both Pie-Chart are interactive too, by clicking on any patricular bar will iterate Data accordingly on other related charts.

### MenuBar
Menu options will be highlighted with different colour icon depends on which page customer surfing on. Such as, if customer is on About Us page, icon of the About Us option in menu will be in dark pink colour.

### Product Page
Product page have clean and tidy design where all the products image have been lined with product name right under every product along with "i" icon. Description for all the product are hidden and will be displayed on demand. Description can be accessed by tapping or clicking on the "i" icon next to the product name.

### Contact US
Contact us form is fully functioning, where customer can fill require field(s) and send their qustions or query to us. This form has been created with help of emailjs. If required field(s) are left blank would show customer a error and form would not be send without those field information. At the end with required field(s) information, once 'Send' clicked or tapped, it will show customer a success message too.

### Feature left to Implement
I will be adding payment feature in future where customer can complete their order solely on website.

I have also added search field, but the coding have bug which I think it is outside of knowledge I have gained so far. However, I have tried to make it functonal and have achieved very little success. I am determined to make it work and will have that functionality up and running in very near future as I ssek more knowledge.

## Testing
I have tested this project on number of devices (iPhone5, iPhoneX, HTC U12+, One Plus One, Pocophone, Samsung s20e, Samsung Tablet, iPad, Honor 7) as well as on desktop I have used majority of web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla, Safari, IE10, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Vivaldi).

Some of Android devices had issue with background image zooming in, which was sorted with media query.

I preferred menu with transparent background for modern look, but that was not feasible for small devices where menu options were getting disappeared in content of website. To resolve this issue, I have created media query where any devices with under 1200 pixel will have background colour for menu options.

Also, floating menu icon was small round for minimal design, but it was barely visible on smaller devices which was pointed out by one of my friend while testing. To resolve this issue, I have decided to make menu icon bit bigger and brighter with well-known burger bar icon.

Footer which is same for all pages have all the marketplace and social media links which are activated except Twitter which yet to be activated. All links are opening the relevant pages in new tab as required and will be highlighted as and when hover over in the desktop mode. For touch functionality device it requires tapping on.

About US and Delivery pages are only containing information about company and services.

Contact Us page have required fields for customer to get in touch with company related to products or order(s). Within the form there are some mandatory fields which needs to be filled with required information before submitting or jumping on next field.

4.  git commit -m - to commit all changes with reason
5.  git push - to add all commited changes to github server which will be followed by username and password for particular account

Also, I have deployed this project using GitHub desktop application. Where application have created a folder in which all files related project should be stored. Any changes made on the files stored within this folder will be picked by application, which needs to be commit and push to GitHub. This project resides under hidayatmansuri.github.io repository
