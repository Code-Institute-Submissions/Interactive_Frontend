Also, on product page will have hidden descriptionwhich will only be display as and when customer required which will give product page nice and clean look.

By tapping or clicking on either of Pie-Chart will interact with related charts to display data.","","### How would I find description of the product?","Under every product image there is product name, right next to product name there is “i” icon. On touchscreen devices customer have to tap on “i” icon or on non touch base devices will have to click-on for description to be appear, which will drop down under related product.

Which will bring Menu-Bar out from left, where there are social media links are displayed right at the end of service list.","","### How to get in touch, in-case if you have any query?","If you click or tap Burger-bar icon located on left top corner of the screen, which will bring Menu out.

This wireframe can be found on following link:","","https://github.com/hidayatmansuri/Interactive_Frontend/blob/master/support/Wireframe_MST.bmpr","","## Features","In the modern days menu bar on larger screen devices embedded on right at the top of the page while for smaller screen device and for the same site menu bar become drop-down. That functionality is great but, if one customer navigating another customer on same website from different screen size devices will have difficulty as menu bar option(s) has been altered or located on different place(s). That is why on this project we have dicided to have same burger bar icon for all the devices located at same place with fix position, which means menu bar icon will be available at any point of website.","","### Dashboard","We will have Dashboard with interactive charts. We are having 2 lots of charts from 2 different marketplaces. Where top charts are belongs to Amazon while bottom are belongs to eBay.","","For Amazon charts there are different ways to filter data, such as choosing Month from combo box located on top or can use brush-on function to choose perticuler duration on 2nd Line-Chart or Bar-Chart. Depends on choosen filter(s), Scattered-Plot-Chart will display orders against average price. While first Line-Chart will display weekly turn over and second will have data for units sold every week. Lastly, Bar-Chart will have information of average price of good sold every week.","","For eBay charts there is same functionality of combo box to choose month to display data accordingly on interactive charts.

Two Pie-Charts are showing Amount spend by every county and amount spen on every product respectively. Both Pie-Chart are interactive too, by clicking on any patricular bar will iterate Data accordingly on other related charts.","","### MenuBar","Menu options will be highlighted with different colour icon depends on which page customer surfing on.

At the end with required field(s) information, once 'Send' clicked or tapped, it will show customer a success message too.","","https://github.com/hidayatmansuri/Interactive_Frontend/blob/master/images/ContactUs.gif","","### Feature left to Implement","I will be adding payment feature in future where customer can complete their order solely on website.","","I have also added search field, but the coding have bug which I think it is outside of knowledge I have gained so far. However, I have tried to make it functonal and have achieved very little success. I am determined to make it work and will have that functionality up and running in very near future as I ssek more knowledge.","","## Testing","I have tested this project on number of devices (iPhone5, iPhoneX, HTC U12+, Google Pixel 3 XL, One Plus One, Pocophone, Samsung s20e, Samsung Tablet, iPad, Honor 7) as well as on desktop I have used majority of web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla, Safari, IE10, Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Edge(Chromium Beta), Opera, Vivaldi). Also, I have tested this project on different desktop with different configuration, where I have notices that Charts are taking bit longer on older generation device while with newer generatio it's lot quicker comparatively.","","About US and Delivery pages are only containing information about company and services. Where on About Us page I have placed map for company's different active locations with addresses right under. Map have no issue with any size of device and any generationof PC or browser, works perfectly for me.","","Contact Us page have required fields for customer to get in touch with company related to products or order(s). Within the form there are some mandatory fields which needs to be filled with required information before submitting or jumping on next field. This form is fully activate and customer can get in touch with company or business providing required field. I have tried few times and it works on all type of devices.","","Dashboard for this project does work but, sometime required refresh on first time for charts to be appear depends on device and processor. Also, charts does not resize themselve if device turn at 90 degree vertically  or horizontally, screen needs to be refreshed and charts will adjust themselves. I have tried to keep charts at fixed size, but would look skalaton on some devices. That is when I have come accross with charts property called \".width($('#chartCumulativeDVH').innerWidth())\" for width and \".height($('#chartCumulativeDVH').innerHeight())\" for height.

That functionality is great but, if one customer navigating another customer on same website from different screen size devices will have difficulty as menu bar option(s) has been altered or located on different place(s). That is why on this project we have decided to have same burger bar icon for all the devices located at same place with fix position, which means menu bar icon will be available at any point of website.","","### Dashboard","We will have Dashboard with interactive charts. We are having 2 lots of charts from 2 different marketplaces. Where top charts are belongs to Amazon while bottom are belongs to eBay.","","For Amazon charts there are different ways to filter data, such as choosing Month from combo box located on top or can use brush-on function to choose duration on 2nd Line-Chart or Bar-Chart. Depends on chosen filter(s), Scattered-Plot-Chart will display orders against average price. While first Line-Chart will display weekly turn over and second will have data for units sold every week.

However, I have tried to make it functional and have achieved very little success. I am determined to make it work and will have that functionality up and running in very near future as I seek more knowledge.","","## Testing","I have tested this project on number of devices (iPhone5, iPhoneX, HTC U12+, Google Pixel 3 XL, One Plus One, Pocophone, Samsung s20e, Samsung Tablet, iPad, Honor 7) as well as on desktop I have used majority of web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla, Safari, IE10, Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Edge(Chromium Beta), Opera, Vivaldi). Also, I have tested this project on different desktop with different configuration, where I have notices that Charts are taking bit longer on older generation device while with newer generation it's lot quicker comparatively.","","About US and Delivery pages are only containing information about company and services. Where on About Us page I have placed map for company's different active locations with addresses right under. Map have no issue with any size of device and any generation of PC or browser, works perfectly for me.","","Contact Us page have required fields for customer to get in touch with company related to products or order(s). Within the form there are some mandatory fields which needs to be filled with required information before submitting or jumping on next field. This form is fully activated and customer can get in touch with company or business providing required field. I have tried few times and it works on all type of devices.","","Dashboard for this project does work but, sometime required refresh on first time for charts to be appear depends on device and processor. Also, charts do not resize themselves if device turn at 90 degree vertically or horizontally, screen needs to be refreshed and charts will adjust themselves. I have tried to keep charts at fixed size but would look skeleton on some devices. That is when I have come across with charts property called \".width($('#chartCumulativeDVH').innerWidth())\" for width and \".height($('#chartCumulativeDVH').innerHeight())\" for height. This property does adjust chart according to screen size but change in screen size does required refresh for these properties to work.","","## Deployment","I have deployed this project on GitHub through AWS Cloud9 using its command base terminal functionality, where it resides under Interactive_Frontend repositories.","","To deploy this project on github using AWS cloud9 commands as follows:","1.  git init - to get into github","2.  git status - to find out all changes have been made within files","3.  git add . - to add all amended files to github server","4.  git commit -m - to commit all changes with reason","5.  git push - to add all committed changes to github server which will be followed by username and password for account","","Also, I have deployed this project using GitHub desktop application.
